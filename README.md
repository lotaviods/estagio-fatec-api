Our API is designed to provide easy access to up-to-date information about student internships, including internship
applications, approvals, placements, and evaluations. With FATEC Internship Management API, developers can easily build
web or mobile applications that enable students, faculty, and administrators to manage internships more efficiently.


This guide will walk you through setting up a Symfony project with Docker for development.
